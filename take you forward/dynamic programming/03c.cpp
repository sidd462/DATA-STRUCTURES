/*Dynamic Programming : Frog Jump (DP 3)
Problem Statement:
Given a number of stairs and a frog, the frog wants to climb from the 0th stair to the (N-1)th stair.
 At a time the frog can climb either one or two steps. A height[N] array is also given. Whenever the frog jumps from a stair i to stair j,
  the energy consumed in the jump is abs(height[i]- height[j]), where abs() means the absolute difference. 
  We need to return the minimum energy that can be used by the frog to jump from stair 0 to stair N-1.
